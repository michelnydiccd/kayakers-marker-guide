# Regulatory and Informational Markers (White with Orange Shapes)

Regulatory and informational markers are white buoys or signs with orange symbols and borders. They convey rules, restrictions, warnings, and general information to boaters. Unlike lateral markers, they do not indicate channel edges but are crucial for safe and lawful navigation.

## Color and Appearance

- **Background:** White.
- **Border and symbol:** Orange.
- **Shapes:** Diamond, circle, square, or diamond‑cross.
- **Text:** Orange letters may be used to specify details (e.g., "NO WAKE", "DANGER", "MARINA").
- **Light characteristic:** If lighted, white light (often flashing).

## Regulatory Markers (Orange Circle)

Regulatory markers indicate rules that must be obeyed. The **orange circle** is the primary symbol for regulations.

### Common Regulations

1. **Speed Limit (NO WAKE)**
   - Orange circle with the words "NO WAKE" or a speed limit (e.g., "5 MPH").
   - Requires operators to proceed at idle speed or within the posted limit.

2. **Exclusion Area (Keep Out)**
   - Orange circle crossed by a horizontal line (like a "no" symbol) or with the words "KEEP OUT".
   - Prohibits entry, typically for swimming areas, dams, or restricted zones.

3. **Directional Arrow**
   - Orange circle containing an arrow.
   - Indicates the direction of travel that must be followed (one‑way traffic).

4. **Water‑Ski Zone**
   - Orange circle with the words "SKI ZONE" or an image of a water skier.
   - Designates an area where water‑skiing is permitted; other vessels should stay clear.

5. **Anchoring Prohibited**
   - Orange circle with an anchor symbol crossed out.
   - Anchoring is not allowed in the marked area.

## Informational Markers (Orange Square)

Informational markers provide useful information without imposing a rule. The **orange square** is the symbol for information.

### Common Information

1. **Distance and Direction**
   - Orange square with arrows and distances (e.g., "MARINA 1 MI →").
   - Guides boaters to facilities, fuel docks, or landing points.

2. **Hazard Warning**
   - Orange square with the word "DANGER", "ROCK", or "WRECK".
   - Alerts to a nearby hazard that does not require a lateral or isolated‑danger mark.

3. **Recreational Area**
   - Orange square with symbols for swimming, picnicking, or camping.
   - Indicates a public recreation site accessible from the water.

4. **Telephone or Emergency**
   - Orange square with a phone symbol or "EMERGENCY".
   - Shows the location of a marine telephone or emergency call box.

## Danger Markers (Orange Diamond)

An **orange diamond** warns of a specific hazard that may not be visible.

### Examples

- **Submerged rocks, stumps, or shallow water.**
- **Dam, waterfall, or strong current ahead.**
- **Pipeline or cable crossing.**
- **Swimming area (warning to boaters, not a prohibition).**

## Controlled Area Markers (Orange Diamond with Cross)

An **orange diamond crossed by an "X"** (diamond‑cross) indicates a **controlled area** where special rules apply.

- **Examples:** Ski‑pick‑up zones, boat‑launch lanes, or areas where a particular activity is regulated.
- Often accompanied by text explaining the control (e.g., "PICK‑UP ONLY").

## Light Characteristics

If a regulatory/informational marker is lighted, it will display a **white light** with a distinctive pattern:

- **Flashing (Fl):** Single flash at regular intervals.
- **Quick Flashing (Qk):** Rapid flashes (about 60 per minute).
- **Morse code:** Some markers use a Morse code letter (e.g., "A" for safe water, but rarely used on regulatory marks).

## Key Takeaways for Kayakers

1. **Orange circle = rule.** Obey the regulation posted.
2. **Orange square = information.** Use it for navigation assistance but it is not mandatory.
3. **Orange diamond = danger.** Proceed with caution; the hazard may be submerged.
4. **Orange diamond with cross = controlled area.** Be aware of special local rules.
5. **Always read the text** on the marker for precise meaning.
6. Regulatory markers are often placed near docks, marinas, swim areas, and narrow channels.
7. As a kayaker, you are subject to the same rules as powerboats when inside regulated zones (e.g., no‑wake areas).
