# Lateral Markers (Red/Green - Nun/Can Shapes)

Lateral markers are the most common type of navigation aids used in the United States to indicate the sides of a channel. They follow the **"Red, Right, Returning"** rule, which helps mariners determine the correct side of the channel when returning from sea.

## Colors and Shapes

### Red Markers (Nun Buoys)
- **Color:** Solid red
- **Shape:** **Nun buoy** – conical shape (pointed top)
- **Position:** Marks the **starboard (right) side** of the channel when returning from sea (heading upstream or toward shore).
- **Topmark:** If present, a red cylinder or triangle.
- **Light characteristic:** Red light (if lighted). Common patterns: flashing red (Fl R), quick flashing red (Qk R), or occulting red (Oc R).

### Green Markers (Can Buoys)
- **Color:** Solid green
- **Shape:** **Can buoy** – cylindrical shape (flat top)
- **Position:** Marks the **port (left) side** of the channel when returning from sea.
- **Topmark:** If present, a green cylinder or square.
- **Light characteristic:** Green light (if lighted). Common patterns: flashing green (Fl G), quick flashing green (Qk G), or occulting green (Oc G).

## The "Red, Right, Returning" Rule

When traveling **toward shore or upstream** (i.e., "returning"), keep **red markers on your starboard (right) side** and **green markers on your port (left) side**.

Conversely, when traveling **away from shore or downstream** (i.e., "leaving"), the sides are reversed: keep green markers on your starboard side and red markers on your port side.

## Light Characteristics (if applicable)

- **Flashing (Fl):** Light flashes at regular intervals (e.g., Fl R 4s = red flash every 4 seconds).
- **Quick Flashing (Qk):** Rapid flashes (about 60 flashes per minute).
- **Occulting (Oc):** Light is on more than it is off.
- **Isophase (Iso):** Equal periods of light and darkness.

## Daymarks (Fixed Lateral Marks)

On posts or pilings, lateral daymarks use the same color scheme:
- **Red triangle** → starboard side.
- **Green square** → port side.

The shape of the daymark reinforces the rule: **"Red, Right, Returning"** – a red triangle points upward (like a nun buoy's cone), while a green square is flat (like a can buoy).

## Key Takeaways for Kayakers

1. Always identify the direction of "returning" (usually heading inland or upstream) before applying the rule.
2. In unfamiliar waters, note the sequence of markers; missing a marker could indicate you are outside the channel.
3. At night, lighted markers provide both color and flash pattern. Memorize the common patterns for your area.
4. When in doubt, stay between the red and green markers.
