# Non-Lateral Markers (Intracoastal Waterway and Others)

Non-lateral markers are used to convey information other than channel edges. The most common system is the **Intracoastal Waterway (ICW)** marking system, which uses **yellow symbols** on red or green lateral markers to indicate ICW-specific routes.

## Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) Markers

The ICW runs along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States. Its markers are standard lateral buoys or daymarks augmented with a **yellow border, yellow triangle, or yellow square**.

### ICW‑Modified Lateral Markers

When a lateral marker also serves the ICW, it displays a **yellow horizontal band** or a **yellow symbol**:

- **Red ICW marker:** A red nun or red triangle daymark with a **yellow horizontal band** (or a **yellow triangle**). The yellow triangle is placed on the red background.
- **Green ICW marker:** A green can or green square daymark with a **yellow horizontal band** (or a **yellow square**). The yellow square is placed on the green background.

**Rule:** The yellow symbol indicates that the marker is part of the ICW. The underlying red/green color still follows the standard lateral rules for the **ICW route**. When traveling the ICW from north to south (Atlantic) or east to west (Gulf), treat the ICW as the "returning" direction.

### ICW‑Specific Shapes

- **Yellow triangle** always appears on a **red background** (starboard side of the ICW).
- **Yellow square** always appears on a **green background** (port side of the ICW).

This reinforces the lateral rule: triangle = red (starboard), square = green (port).

## Other Non‑Lateral Markers

### Safe Water Marks (Mid‑Channel Marks)

- **Color:** Red and white vertical stripes.
- **Shape:** Sphere (buoy) or pillar (daymark).
- **Purpose:** Indicates safe water all around, often used to mark the center of a channel, landfall, or fairway.
- **Light characteristic:** White light, often Morse code "A" (short‑long) or Isophase.

### Isolated Danger Marks

- **Color:** Black with one or more red horizontal bands.
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar buoy.
- **Purpose:** Marks an isolated hazard (rock, wreck) with safe water all around the mark.
- **Light characteristic:** White group flashing (Fl (2)) or other distinctive pattern.

### Special Marks

- **Color:** Yellow.
- **Shape:** Any shape not conflicting with lateral marks (often a pillar or can).
- **Purpose:** Indicates a special area or feature (e.g., anchorage, cable crossing, recreational zone).
- **Light characteristic:** Yellow light (if lighted).

### Cardinal Marks

- **Color:** Yellow and black horizontal bands, with black double cones as topmarks.
- **Shape:** Pillar or spar.
- **Purpose:** Indicate the direction of safe water relative to the mark (North, East, South, West). Used more in international waters but sometimes seen in U.S. waters.
- **Light characteristic:** White light with specific flash patterns (e.g., quick flashing for North).

## Key Takeaways for Kayakers

1. **ICW markers** are your guide when paddling the Intracoastal Waterway. Remember that the yellow symbol does not change the lateral rule—it simply tells you the marker is part of the ICW.
2. **Safe water marks** (red‑and‑white) mean you are in the middle of a channel; you may pass on either side.
3. **Isolated danger marks** warn of a single hazard; keep a safe distance but note that safe water exists all around the mark.
4. **Special marks** (yellow) alert you to areas with unique regulations or features (e.g., swimming zones, underwater cables).
5. When in doubt, consult a local chart or Coast Guard notice for the specific meaning of non‑standard markers.
